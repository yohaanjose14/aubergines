Take the eggplant and cut it into long oval strips about half an inch thick.
Put olive oil and bake it at 180ÂºC  for 20 mins.
During this time lets create the mix.
Add mascarpone cheeze and all the other ingredients except the tomato purÃ©e and mix them well. Remember the mozzarella cheeze must be grated.
Heat a fying pan with olive oil at 120ÂºC and slowly add the purÃ©e.
Saute the purÃ©e for about 5mins.
By this time your eggplant would have been baked.
Remember that when you add the chicken to the mix it must be chopped into tiny bite sized pieces.
Place the mix on the baked eggplants and roll the eggplant into a cylinder.
Dress the rolls with freshly cut ðŸ«’ olives.
Bake the aubergines at 200Âº for 45mins.
Your aubergines are ready to eat.
Bon apetite !!!
